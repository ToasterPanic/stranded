# Stranded

Survive on a deserted against increasingly-dangerous enemies, and try to get SOMEONE to notice you're there. Fish, craft and build to prepare during the day, defend and try to signal for help at night.

All things considered, I think this game turned out pretty good. I didn't get as much work done as I thought I would, but this is a fullish game (albeit with a few major bugs.)

Credits are included in-game.

## Things to know
- To win, you need to grab the attention of a plane during the night. You'll need to use a Smoke Starter, then point your Makeshift Laser Pointer at the plane to get its attention.
- You need metal bait to get the parts you need for those two items.
- UFOs don't exist, they can't hurt you.
